# 🎲 Number Guessing Game

This is a simple Python game where the player has to guess a random number between 1 and 100 within 5 tries. 
It's a fun little project to demonstrate basic Python skills like conditionals, loops, user input, and error handling.

## 📜 How to Play

1. The program welcomes the player and asks for their name.
2. The player is asked if they want to play.
3. If they say "yes", the game:
   - Randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
   - Gives the player 5 chances to guess the number.
   - Provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low.
4. If the player guesses correctly, they win 🎉
5. If they run out of guesses, the game ends ❌
